Ever drown in countless notification and lose track of what's most interesting? Use personal TLDR to let AI sort and digest your subscription pushes.

Wire the subscriptions
- ~Apple Podcast~ (extend: use universal podcast search API)
- ~Youtube~
  - to pull caption, need OAuth2
  - can we use audio -> llm -> summary instead? need to estimate cost
- TLDR, AlphaSignal, Snack newsletter
- BILIBILI
- [pending verification] The Batch newsletter
- [pending verification] a16z, sequoia website
- [pending verification] deeplearning course

- wechat 公众号？
    - https://github.com/cooderl/wewe-rss
    - https://sugar404.notion.site/ (新版huggingface部署wewe-rss教程)
- substack


- the final rendering could be a beautiful svg card
- use AI to summarize the multimedia (cost?)
